A comprehensive employee feedback management system built with a modern React (Material-UI) frontend and FastAPI backend, featuring document uploads, announcements, assignments, peer feedback, real-time notifications, and more.

## üÜï What's New (2024)
- **Modern Material-UI Frontend:** All dashboards and forms use Material-UI for a clean, responsive, and professional look.
- **Notification Popover with Dismiss:** Notification bell opens a popover with a list of notifications. Each notification can be individually dismissed (with an X), keeping the list tidy.
- **Assignment Management:**
  - Managers can upload assignments (with title, description, due date, and file).
  - Employees are notified, can view assignments, and submit their work.
  - Submission upload and tracking for each assignment.
- **Assignment Comments:**
  - Transparent comment section for each assignment (employees and managers can discuss, ask questions, and get notified of new comments).
- **Toast Notifications:** All user actions (upload, submit, comment, errors) use toast notifications for instant feedback.
- **Backend Dockerfile Fix:** Docker image now installs all dependencies correctly (no more missing 'click' or other packages).
